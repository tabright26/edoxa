      MEMBER FEEDBACK POLICY
    </div>
    <div
      className="card-body"
    >
      <p>
        While using the Services, and as a continuing condition of your use of eDoxa, you agree to comply with the Site's policy on feedback. Abuse of the Site's feedback system undermines the integrity of the feedback system and decreases trust within the community. eDoxa is not legally responsible for the remarks that members post, even if those remarks are defamatory. However, this law does not protect the person who leaves the feedback, therefore the member would be responsible for it. There are limited occasions when eDoxa will remove feedback comments.
      </p>
      <p>
        eDoxa will remove feedback ratings and comments if they meet the standard for feedback abuse or members mutually agree. Feedback that meets any of the circumstances below is feedback abuse and may be subject to removal:
      </p>
      <p>
        eDoxa is provided with a court order finding that the feedback is libelous, slanderous, defamatory or otherwise illegal.
      </p>
      <p>
        The feedback comment contains profane, vulgar, obscene, or racist language or adult material.
      </p>
      <p>
        The feedback comment contains personal identifying information about another member, including real name, address, phone number, e-mail address, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        The feedback comment contains links or scripts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Feedback left by members who are indefinitely suspended for certain policy violations or are in violation of the T&Cs.
      </p>
      <p
        className="mb-0"
      >
        If members suspect that feedback left for them is in violation of the Site's feedback policy and constitutes abuse, they are encouraged to email 
        <a
          href="mailto:undefined"
        />
         to report this violation. eDoxa will also offer the opportunity to members to withdraw feedback if both members mutually agree to the removal of a specified comment or feedback rating. Both members must email 
        <a
          href="mailto:undefined"

      ANTI-SPAM POLICY
    </div>
    <div
      className="card-body"
    >
      <p>
        eDoxa prohibits any activity commonly referred to as "Spam". Members who are reported and whose claims of "Spam" are validated by eDoxa will have their respective accounts either immediately TERMINATED or SUSPENDED, at the sole discretion of eDoxa.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, any winnings (if any) may be voided at the sole discretion of eDoxa. eDoxa defines "Spam" as:
      </p>
      <ul
        className="mb-0"
      >
        <li>
          Electronic mail messages addressed to a recipient with whom the initiator does not have an existing business or personal relationship or is not sent at the request of, or with the express consent of, the recipient;
        </li>
        <li>
          Messages posted to Usenet and message boards that are off-topic (unrelated to the topic of discussion), cross-posted to unrelated message boards or discussion threads, or posted in excessive volume;
        </li>
        <li>
          Solicitations posted to chat rooms, or to groups or individuals via Internet Relay Chat or "Instant Messaging" system (such as Skype);  eDoxa may undertake, at its sole discretion and with or without prior notice, the following enforcement actions:
        </li>
        <li>
          Account Suspension: Upon the receipt of a credible and validated complaint, eDoxa may also elect to immediately suspend the membership of the member implicated in the abuse. Suspension serves as a "Final" warning and will prevent the member from continuing their abusive "Spamming" behavior. eDoxa will evaluate each validated abuse incident on a case-by-case basis and impose Termination or Suspension at its sole discretion, and may void any associated winnings. The Site reserves the right to lift the suspension of a member at any time, at its sole discretion.
        </li>
        <li>
          Account Termination: Upon the receipt of a credible and validated complaint, the Site may immediately terminate the membership of the individual member implicated in the abuse and may void any associated winnings.
